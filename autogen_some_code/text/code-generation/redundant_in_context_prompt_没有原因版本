The following text delimeted by triple quotes is a solution to a specific problem and given by a LLM. Notice that the solution may be rebundant, to be specific, the rebundancy of the solution contain the following situations with a example after the rebundant type delimited by triple single quotes:
    1. The names of variables in the solution are superfluous.
    The example is as following:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    2. The solution contain rebundant and extraneous steps.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Substep 1.1: Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []

    # Substep 1.2: Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []

    # Step 2: Loop through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Substep 2.1: Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Substep 2.1.1: Append the number to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            # Substep 2.1.2: Append the number to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(num)
    ''' 
    3. The comments of the every step  are overexplained in painstaking detail and are excessively verbose.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of integers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    # Step 2: Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []

    # Step 3: Loop through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Step 4: Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Step 5: If the number is even, append it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(num)
            
            # Step 6: Generate an intermediate output to show the number being added
            print(f"Adding {num} to the even_numbers list...")

    # Step 7: Generate another intermediate output to show the even_numbers list
    print("List of even numbers:", even_numbers)

    # Step 8: Calculate the sum of even numbers
    sum_of_even_numbers = sum(even_numbers)

    # Step 9: Generate an intermediate output to show the sum
    print(f"Sum of even numbers: {sum_of_even_numbers}")

    # Step 10: Provide a final output with a verbose comment
    print("The program has successfully calculated the sum of even numbers in the list.")

    ''' 
    4.Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    5. Unnecessary loops.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    6. Excessive function calls.
    The example is as following:    
    '''
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    result = add(3, 4)
    result2 = add(add(1, 2), add(3, 4))
    ''' 
    7. complex code.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    def complex_calculation(a, b):
        result = 0
        for i in range(a):
            for j in range(b):
                result += i * j
        return result
