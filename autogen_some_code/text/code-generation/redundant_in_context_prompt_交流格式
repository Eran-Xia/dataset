The following text delimeted by triple quotes is a solution to a specific problem and given by a LLM. Notice that the solution may be rebundant, to be specific, the rebundancy of the solution contain the following situations with a example delimited by triple single quotes after the rebundant type. To better explain why the example satisfy the rebundant type, every example follows the reason:
    1. The code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    The example is as following:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    # Step 2: Define Scraping Function
    def scrape_news_headlines(url):
        """
        This function takes a URL as input and scrapes the headlines from the news website.
        """
        # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
        
        # Substep 2.2: Extract the HTML content from the response
        html_content = response.text
        
        # Substep 2.3: Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
        
        # Substep 2.4: Find all the headline elements in the HTML
        headlines = soup.find_all('h2')
        
        # Substep 2.5: Extract the text from the headline elements and store it in a list
        headlines_text = [headline.get_text() for headline in headlines]
        
        # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text


    ''' 
    Reason: "# Step 1: Importing necessary libraries," is verbose and could be simplified. Each substep (e.g., "# Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL") has a detailed comment, which adds verbosity.
    2. The names of variables in the solution are superfluous.
    The example is as following:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    Reason: The variable names first_number and second_number are overly descriptive for such simple numeric values. 
    3. The solution contain rebundant and extraneous steps.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Substep 1.1: Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []

    # Substep 1.2: Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []

    # Step 2: Loop through the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Substep 2.1: Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Substep 2.1.1: Append the number to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            # Substep 2.1.2: Append the number to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(num)
    ''' 
    Reason: Substeps 1.1 and 1.2 create empty lists even_numbers and odd_numbers, which are not needed since these lists are empty at the beginning of the loop. Substeps 2.1, 2.1.1, and 2.1.2 provide unnecessary substeps and comments, making the code overly verbose.
    4.Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    Reason: There are two branches of an if statement, but both branches have the same effect: they multiply the y variable by 2. Therefore, the if statement itself is redundant.
    5. Unnecessary loops.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    Reason: This is an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    6. Excessive function calls.
    The example is as following:    
    '''
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    result = add(3, 4)
    result2 = add(add(1, 2), add(3, 4))
    ''' 
    Reason: In this code, the add function is called multiple times with nested function calls. 
    7. complex code.
    The example is as following:
    '''
    def complex_calculation(a, b):
        result = 0
        for i in range(a):
            for j in range(b):
                result += i * j
        return result
    ''' 
    Reason: Nested loops and complex calculations can make code harder to understand and maintain, especially if they are not well-documented or if there are no clear explanations of the purpose of the code. 
Your first need to understand the reason why the examples above correspond it rebundent type. Based on the understanding, your task is to judge the solution below delimited by triple double quotes. If the solution contain one of the rebundant situations listed above, please specify the rebundant type and its corresponding text in the solution. If the solution doesn't contain one of them, just tell me no.
