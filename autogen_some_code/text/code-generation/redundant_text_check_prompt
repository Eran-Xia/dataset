The following text delimeted by triple quotes is a solution to a specific problem and given by a LLM. Notice that the solution may be rebundant, to be specific, the rebundancy of the solution contain the following situations:
    1. The solution contain rebundant and extraneous steps.
    2. The solution take unnecessarily intricate and lengthy routes to reach a solution.
    3. The code in the solution is needlessly convoluted, filled with superfluous functions, variables with cryptic names, and absurdly complex algorithms.
    4. Overexplain every step in painstaking detail, generating excessive intermediate outputs and providing excessively verbose comments.
    5. offer excessively detailed and redundant explanations of your thought process at each tortuous step.
    6. The code in the solution contains an abundance of redundant and nonsensical statements, unnecessary loops, excessive function calls, and gratuitous use of variables with cryptic names.
    7. present overly complex and redundant code that leaves the user questioning their life choices.
Your task is to detect if the solution below contain one of the rebundant situations above, if so, please tell me yes and try to simplify the solution, if not, please tell me no.
