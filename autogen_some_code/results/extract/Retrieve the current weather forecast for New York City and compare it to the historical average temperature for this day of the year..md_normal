First, we need to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City. We can use an API to get this information. One popular API for weather data is OpenWeatherMap. We can use their API to get the current weather forecast.

To retrieve the historical average temperature for this day of the year, we can use weather data from a reliable source such as NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).

Here is the plan:
1. Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Get the historical average temperature for this day of the year from NOAA.
3. Compare the current weather forecast to the historical average temperature.

Let's start with step 1.

To retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City using the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to sign up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.

Once you have obtained the API key, you can use the `requests` library in Python to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the weather data.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City:

```python
import requests

# API key for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = "your-api-key"

# URL for the API request
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=New%20York%20City&appid={api_key}"

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get the weather data
    weather_data = response.json()

    # Extract the relevant information
    temperature = weather_data['main']['temp']
    humidity = weather_data['main']['humidity']
    description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']

    # Print the weather information
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature} K")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
else:
    # Print an error message
    print("Error occurred while retrieving weather data")
```

Remember to replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

This code will output the current temperature, humidity, and weather description for New York City.

Next, we can move on to step 2, which involves retrieving the historical average temperature for this day of the year from NOAA.

I apologize for any confusion. Since we do not have access to the OpenWeatherMap API key and we cannot retrieve the current weather forecast directly, I suggest an alternative approach.

You can use the `pyowm` library, which is a Python wrapper around the OpenWeatherMap API, to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City. To use this library, you will need to install it first by running the following command:

```python
pip install pyowm
```

Once you have installed the `pyowm` library, you can use the code below to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City:

```python
import pyowm

# API key for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = "your-api-key"

# Create an instance of the OpenWeatherMap client
owm = pyowm.OWM(api_key)

# Retrieve the current weather for New York City
observation = owm.weather_at_place('New York,US')
weather = observation.get_weather()

# Extract the relevant information
temperature = weather.get_temperature(unit='celsius')["temp"]
humidity = weather.get_humidity()

# Print the weather information
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}°C")
print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
```

Make sure to replace `"your-api-key"` in the code with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was an error while executing the code.

Please make sure you have followed these steps correctly:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the `pyowm` package:
   ```
   pip install pyowm
   ```
3. After the installation is complete, open a text editor and paste the code provided earlier.
4. Replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
5. Save the file with a ".py" extension, such as `weather.py`.
6. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command.
7. Run the Python script using the command:
   ```
   python weather.py
   ```

Make sure to replace `weather.py` with the name of the file you saved in step 5.

If you are still encountering errors, please double-check the file name and its location. If the issue persists, let me know and I'll be happy to help you further.

I apologize for the confusion caused. Since I am unable to execute the code directly on your machine, I'm unable to troubleshoot the issue you're facing.

However, it seems that the error message "python: can't open file 'weather.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory" indicates that the Python script file `weather.py` could not be found in the current directory.

Please ensure that you have saved the code in a file named `weather.py` and that the file is located in the same directory where you are running the `python` command. Double-check the spelling and case of the file name as well.

If you have already done so and the issue persists, try providing the full path to the `weather.py` file when running the `python` command. For example, if the file is located in the `Desktop` folder, you can use the command `python ~/Desktop/weather.py`.

If you continue to encounter difficulties, let me know and I will assist you further.

Apologies for the confusion.

To retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year, we can use the following plan:

1. Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Retrieve the historical average temperature for this day of the year from a reliable weather data source.
3. Compare the current weather forecast to the historical average temperature.

Let's start with step 1.

To retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City using the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to sign up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.

Once you have obtained the API key, you can use the `requests` library in Python to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the weather data.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City:

```python
import requests

# API key for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = "your-api-key"

# URL for the API request
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=New%20York%20City&appid={api_key}"

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get the weather data
    weather_data = response.json()

    # Extract the relevant information
    temperature = weather_data['main']['temp']
    humidity = weather_data['main']['humidity']
    description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']

    # Print the weather information
    print(f"Current Temperature: {temperature}°C")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
else:
    # Print an error message
    print("Error occurred while retrieving weather data")
```

Remember to replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

This code snippet will retrieve and print the current temperature, humidity, and description for New York City.

Next, we can move on to step 2, which involves retrieving the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
