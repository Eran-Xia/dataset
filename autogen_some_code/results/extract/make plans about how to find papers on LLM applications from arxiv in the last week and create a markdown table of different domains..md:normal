Sure! Here's a detailed plan to find papers on LLM applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table of different domains:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import requests
from datetime import date, timedelta
import pandas as pd
```

2. Determine the date range for the last week:
```python
end_date = date.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=7)
```

3. Make a request to the arXiv API to fetch the papers within the date range:
```python
url = f"http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat:cs.LG+AND+submittedDate:[{start_date}T00:00:00Z TO {end_date}T23:59:59Z]&start=0&max_results=100"
response = requests.get(url)
```

4. Parse the XML response and extract the relevant information from each paper:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.fromstring(response.content)
papers = []

for entry in tree.iter('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}entry'):
    title = entry.find('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}title').text
    date = entry.find('{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}published').text
    domain = entry.find('{http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom}primary_category').attrib['term']
    papers.append({'Title': title, 'Published Date': date, 'Domain': domain})
```

5. Create a pandas DataFrame from the extracted data:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(papers)
```

6. Group the papers by domain and count the number of papers in each domain:
```python
domain_counts = df['Domain'].value_counts().reset_index()
domain_counts.columns = ['Domain', 'Count']
```

7. Create the markdown table:
```python
markdown_table = df.to_markdown()
```

8. Print the markdown table:
```python
print(markdown_table)
```

That's it! You now have a plan to find papers on LLM applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table of different domains. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Thank you for checking the output. It seems that there are no papers returned from the arXiv API for the specified date range and category. This could be due to a lack of new papers matching the search criteria.

To further investigate the issue, let's add some print statements to display the URL used to make the API request. Here's the modified code:

```python
import requests

Please run this updated code, and if there are no papers found, you will see a message indicating that. If there are papers found, the markdown table will be generated as before. Let me know if you have any further questions!

Text redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Unnecessary steps
    Example 1:
    '''
    #Step 2: Install an e-book reader application
    '''
    In example 1, the user's need is to "find an e-book of The Little Prince", there is no need to install an e-book reader application.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: have a knowledge of the author's life story
    '''
    In example 2, the user's need is to "search for a certain book and summarize it", there is no need to have a knowledge of the author's life story.
    Type 2: irrelevant issues
    Example 3:
    '''
​    before you search for an e-book of The Little Prince, you should register a CSDN account first.
    ''' 
    In example 3, "find an e-book" has nothing to do with "register a CSDN account".

Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    Test/Code redundant type x: ...its correspond text... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.
