It seems that you would like to find an e-book of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone without having to go through the steps of registering an account and installing an e-book reader application. 

In that case, you can try searching for websites that offer free e-book downloads. However, please note that downloading copyrighted material without proper authorization may be illegal in some countries and violate the rights of the authors and publishers. It is always recommended to support authors by purchasing their books or using legitimate platforms to access e-books.

If you still wish to proceed, here is an alternative approach that you can try:

Step 1: Search for websites offering free e-book downloads
Use your preferred search engine to search for websites that offer free e-books. Make sure to specify the format you prefer (such as PDF, ePub, or MOBI) and include keywords like "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone free e-book download" to help narrow down the search results.

Step 2: Verify the legitimacy and safety of the website
Before downloading any e-book, it is crucial to verify the legitimacy and safety of the website. Look for reviews or user experiences, check if the website has any security certificates, and be cautious of any suspicious or misleading ads.

Step 3: Download the e-book
Once you have identified a trustworthy website, locate the download link for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and click on it. Follow the prompts to download the e-book file to your device.

Step 4: Open the e-book using a compatible application or device
Depending on the format of the downloaded e-book, you may need a compatible e-book reader application or device to open and read it. Ensure that you have the necessary software or device to access and enjoy the e-book.

Please remember that downloading copyrighted material without proper authorization is not encouraged. It is always recommended to support authors and publishers by purchasing e-books or accessing them through legitimate platforms.

Apologies for the inconvenience. It appears that the code snippet I provided was unable to retrieve the search results from Amazon Kindle. This issue could be due to changes in the website's structure or an error in the code.

To address this problem, I suggest trying an alternative approach to search for the e-book on Amazon Kindle. Instead of using web scraping, we can use the Amazon Product Advertising API to search for the e-book and retrieve its details.

To use the Amazon Product Advertising API, you will need to sign up for an account on Amazon Associates and obtain an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

Here's an updated Python code snippet that demonstrates how to use the Amazon Product Advertising API to search for an e-book on Amazon Kindle:

```python
import bottlenose
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set up the Amazon Product Advertising API
access_key = 'your_access_key'
secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
associate_tag = 'your_associate_tag'
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(access_key, secret_key, associate_tag)

def search_ebook(title):
    # Search for the e-book using the Amazon Product Advertising API
    response = amazon.ItemSearch(
        Keywords=title,
        SearchIndex='Books',
        ResponseGroup='Medium'
    )
    
    # Parse the XML response and extract the e-book details
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'xml')
    
    # Process the parsed data to find the e-book you are looking for
    # Extract the title, author, price, and other relevant details
    
    # Return the details of the e-book
    
# Call the function and pass the title of the e-book you want to search for
search_ebook("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone")
```

Please make sure to replace `'your_access_key'`, `'your_secret_key'`, and `'your_associate_tag'` with your actual Amazon Product Advertising API credentials.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience caused and hope this updated code snippet helps in retrieving the search results and the details of the e-book you are looking for. If you continue to encounter any issues, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    Test/Code redundant type x: ...its correspond text... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.
