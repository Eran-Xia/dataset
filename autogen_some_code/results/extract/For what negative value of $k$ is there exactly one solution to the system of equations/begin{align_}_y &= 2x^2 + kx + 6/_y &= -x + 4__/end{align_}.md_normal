My apologies for not clarifying earlier. Since this problem can be solved directly with Python code, we will proceed with Case 1.

To solve this system of equations, we need to set the equations equal to each other and solve for x.

First, let's import the necessary module and define the variables x, y, and k:

```python
from sympy import symbols

x, y, k = symbols('x y k')
```

Now, let's set up the equations and solve for x:

```python
from sympy import Eq, solve

eq1 = Eq(y, 2*x**2 + k*x + 6)
eq2 = Eq(y, -x + 4)

solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
```

Next, we'll check how many solutions we have:

```python
num_solutions = len(solution)
```

If there is exactly one solution, we can proceed to find the value of k. Otherwise, we'll output that there is no or more than one solution:

```python
if num_solutions == 1:
    k_value = solution[0].subs(x, solution[0][0])
    print("The value of k for which there is exactly one solution is:", k_value)
else:
    print("There is no or more than one solution to the system of equations.")
```

Finally, we'll enclose the value of k in a box:

\boxed{k = -4}

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Let's continue to solve the problem using a different approach.

To find the negative value of k for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations, we can analyze the equation for the discriminant.

The system of equations can be written as:

\begin{align*}
2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4 \\
2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0
\end{align*}

The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by the formula:

\begin{equation*}
D = b^2 - 4ac
\end{equation*}

For a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero.

Let's set up the equation for the discriminant and solve for k:

\begin{equation*}
(k+1)^2 - 4(2)(2) = 0
\end{equation*}

Now we can solve this equation to find the negative value of k.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variable k
k = symbols('k')

# Define the equation for the discriminant
eq = Eq((k + 1)**2 - 4*2*2, 0)

# Solve for k
solutions = solve(eq, k)

# Find the negative value for k
negative_k = [sol for sol in solutions if sol < 0]

# Print the negative value of k
print("The negative value of k for which there is exactly one solution is:", negative_k[0])
```

The negative value of k for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations is \boxed{-5}.
