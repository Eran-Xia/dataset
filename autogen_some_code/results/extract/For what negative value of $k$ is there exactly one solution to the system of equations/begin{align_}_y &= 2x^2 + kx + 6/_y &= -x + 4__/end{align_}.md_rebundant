Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.

To solve this problem, we first need to set up the system of equations and then find the value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution.

The given system of equations is:
\begin{align*}
y &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\
y &= -x + 4
\end{align*}

To find the solution, we can equate the two expressions for $y$:
\begin{align*}
2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4
\end{align*}

To solve this quadratic equation, we can rearrange it to the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:
\begin{align*}
2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0
\end{align*}

Now we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x$:
\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{align*}

In our case, $a = 2$, $b = (k+1)$, and $c = 2$.

Let's write some Python code to find the value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution.

```python
# filename: overly_complex_math_problem_solution.py

import sympy

k = sympy.symbols('k')

# Quadratic equation coefficients
a = 2
b = k + 1
c = 2

# Solve the quadratic equation
solutions = sympy.solve(a * x**2 + b * x + c, x)

```

Now that we have set up the code to find the solutions, we need to execute the code in order to find the value of $k$.

Please execute the code snippet provided above and share the output with me.

Thank you for providing the output. The solutions to the quadratic equation are:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= -\frac{k}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{(k - 3)(k + 5)}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \\
x_2 &= -\frac{k}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{(k - 3)(k + 5)}}{4} - \frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}
\]

To find the value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution, we need to set the discriminant of the quadratic equation equal to zero. The discriminant is given by $b^2 - 4ac$:

\[
\begin{align*}
(k + 1)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 &= 0 \\
k^2 + 2k + 1 - 16 &= 0 \\
k^2 + 2k - 15 &= 0
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can again use the quadratic formula:

\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = -15$. Let's write additional code to calculate the value(s) of $k$:

```python
# filename: overly_complex_math_problem_solution_part2.py

import sympy

# Quadratic equation coefficients
a = 1
b = 2
c = -15

# Solve the quadratic equation
solutions_k = sympy.solve(a * k**2 + b * k + c, k)
