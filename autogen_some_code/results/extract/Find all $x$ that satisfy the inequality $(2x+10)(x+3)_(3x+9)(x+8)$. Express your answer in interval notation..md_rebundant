Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.

To solve the given inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we will follow the third case mentioned in the requirements. We will solve the problem step by step and ask queries whenever necessary.

Step 1: Expand the expressions on both sides of the inequality:
$(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 < 3x^2 + 27x + 72$

Step 2: Simplify the inequality by subtracting the common terms from both sides:
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 - (3x^2 + 27x + 72) < 0$
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 - 3x^2 - 27x - 72 < 0$
$-x^2 - 11x - 42 < 0$

Step 3: Ask Python to solve the quadratic equation $-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$ and find the solutions for x.

As per your request, I will continue to solve the problem until I need to query. Let's proceed with the solution.

Step 4: Factorize the quadratic equation $-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$ to find the solutions for x. To factorize the quadratic equation, we can write it in the form $(x - a)(x - b) = 0$, where a and b are the solutions.

$-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$
$-(x^2 + 11x + 42) = 0$
$(x + 6)(x + 7) = 0$

Step 5: Set each factor to zero to find the values of x that satisfy the equation:

$x + 6 = 0$
$x = -6$

$x + 7 = 0$
$x = -7$

Step 6: We have obtained the solutions $x = -6$ and $x = -7$. Now we need to find the intervals where the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$ holds true.

Step 7: Check the sign of the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for values of x in different intervals to determine when the inequality is satisfied.

To do this, we will create a number line and test the expression for three different intervals: 

Interval 1: $(-\infty, -7)$
Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$
Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$

Step 8: Test the expression for each interval:

For Interval 1: $(-\infty, -7)$
Choose a value x that is less than -7, for example, -10:
$-(-10)^2 - 11(-10) - 42 < 0$
$-100 + 110 - 42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$math_question_list-100 + 110 - 42 = -32 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 1.

Step 9: Ask Python to calculate the expression for Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$.

Apologies for the delay. As per your request, let's continue solving the problem until we need to query. 

Step 9: As mentioned earlier, we will now calculate the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for the interval $(-7, -6)$ to determine if the inequality holds true.

For Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$
Choose a value x between -7 and -6, for example, -6.5:
$-(-6.5)^2 - 11(-6.5) - 42 < 0$
$-42.25 + 71.5 - 42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$-42.25 + 71.5 - 42 = -12.75 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 2 as well.

Step 10: Ask Python to calculate the expression for Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$.

Apologies for the delay. As per your request, let's continue solving the problem until we need to query.

Step 10: Let's calculate the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for the interval $(-6, \infty)$ to check if the inequality holds true.

For Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$
Choose a value x greater than -6, for example, 0:
$-(0)^2 - 11(0) - 42 < 0$
$-42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$-42 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 3 as well.

Step 11: Now that we have determined that the inequality holds true for all three intervals, we can write the solution in interval notation.

The solution to the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$ is $x \in \boxed{(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)}$.
