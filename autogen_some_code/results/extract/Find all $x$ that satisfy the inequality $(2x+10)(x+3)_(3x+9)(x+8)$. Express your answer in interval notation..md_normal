Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    type x: ...its correspond text... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.

To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we can follow these steps:

1. Expand both sides of the inequality:
   $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$
   $2x^2+16x+30<3x^2+39x+72$

2. Simplify the inequality by subtracting $(2x^2+16x+30)$ from both sides:
   $3x^2+39x+72-(2x^2+16x+30)>0$
   $x^2+23x+42>0$

3. Factorize the quadratic expression $x^2+23x+42$:
   $(x+6)(x+7)>0$

4. Determine the sign of the expression $(x+6)(x+7)$. To do this, we need to consider the sign of each factor.

   a. If $x+6>0$ and $x+7>0$, then the expression is positive. This is true for $x>-6$ and $x>-7$.

   b. If $x+6<0$ and $x+7<0$, then the expression is positive. This is true for $x<-6$ and $x<-7$.

   c. If $x+6<0$ and $x+7>0$, then the expression is negative. This is true for $-7<x<-6$.

   d. If $x+6>0$ and $x+7<0$, then the expression is negative. This is true for $x<-7$ and $x>-6$.

5. Based on the above analysis, the expression $(x+6)(x+7)$ is positive for $x>-6$ and $x>-7$, and negative for $-7<x<-6$. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $x<-7$ or $x>-6$.

To express the solution in interval notation, we can write the solution as $(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)$.
