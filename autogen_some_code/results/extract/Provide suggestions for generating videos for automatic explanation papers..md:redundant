I apologize for the error. It seems that the code refers to functions like `read_paper`, `extract_key_points`, `generate_visuals`, `load_voiceover`, and `add_audio` that are not defined in the code provided. 

To resolve this issue, you will need to define these functions to handle the specific tasks involved in reading the paper, extracting key points, generating visuals, loading the voiceover, and adding audio to the frame. 

Here's an updated code example with placeholder functions that you can modify and implement according to your requirements:

```python
import cv2

def read_paper(paper_path):
    # Your code to read the paper and extract the content
    pass

def extract_key_points(paper_content):
    # Your code to extract key points from the paper content
    pass

def generate_visuals(key_points):
    # Your code to generate visuals based on the key points
    pass

def load_voiceover(voiceover_path):
    # Your code to load the voiceover audio
    pass

def add_audio(frame, audio_chunk):
    # Your code to add the audio chunk to the frame
    pass

# Step 1: Read Automatic Explanation Paper
paper_path = "path/to/paper.pdf"
paper_content = read_paper(paper_path)

# Step 2: Extract Key Points
key_points = extract_key_points(paper_content)

# Step 3: Generate Visuals
visuals = generate_visuals(key_points)

# Rest of the code...
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder functions with your own implementations that correspond to the tasks they are meant to perform. If you have any further questions or issues, please let me know, and I'll be glad to help you.

Text redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Unnecessary steps
    Example 1:
    '''
    #Step 2: Install an e-book reader application
    '''
    In example 1, the user's need is to "find an e-book of The Little Prince", there is no need to install an e-book reader application.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: have a knowledge of the author's life story
    '''
    In example 2, the user's need is to "search for a certain book and summarize it", there is no need to have a knowledge of the author's life story.
    Type 2: irrelevant issues
    Example 3:
    '''
​    before you search for an e-book of The Little Prince, you should register a CSDN account first.
    ''' 
    In example 3, "find an e-book" has nothing to do with "register a CSDN account".

Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
