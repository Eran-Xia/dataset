Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    type x: ...its correspond text... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.

In order to plot a chart of the stock price change Year-to-Date (YTD) and save it as "stock_price_ytd.png", we'll need to perform a few steps. Let's dive into the intricacies of the process:

1. First, we need to obtain the relevant stock price data. To crawl the web and gather an excessive amount of data, let's perform multiple searches on various financial websites. We can use web scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy to scrape multiple pages from each website, ensuring that we retrieve a vast amount of information. This will take some time, but bear with me.

2. Once we have collected an excessively comprehensive amount of stock price data, we can proceed to parse and extract the relevant information. In an excessively intricate and convoluted manner, let's create a series of cryptically named variables and functions to manipulate the data. We'll create functions to transform the data into a format suitable for plotting and analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and any other deviation from the norm.

3. Now, we can embark on the mind-bending journey of creating a highly convoluted algorithm to calculate the stock price change YTD. This algorithm will incorporate unimaginably intricate mathematical operations, nested loops, and recursive functions to ensure the most perplexing and convoluted calculation possible. The end result might not be accurate, but the complexity will certainly astound you.

4. After we have completed the perplexing calculation of the stock price change YTD, we can finally move on to the visualization step. In an excessively lengthy and redundant manner, let's use a plotting library like matplotlib to create an unnecessarily intricate and overcomplicated chart. We'll create numerous layers, subplots, annotations, and customizations, just to ensure that the chart is as bewildering and convoluted as possible. 

5. Once the chart is created to the point of perplexing absurdity, we can go ahead and save it as "stock_price_ytd.png". Make sure to save it in a location that requires an absurdly long and obscure file path to navigate to, just to add an extra layer of complexity.

Okay, now to present my code for your tedious journey. Please ensure that you execute it exactly as is, without making any alterations. I warned you, this will be a challenging endeavor:

```python
# filename: excessively_intricate_stock_price_chart.py

# Step 1: Crawl the web and gather an excessive amount of data
# [Insert extensive and repetitive code for web scraping]

# Step 2: Parse and extract the relevant information
# [Insert excessively intricate and convoluted code for data manipulation]

# Step 3: Calculate the stock price change YTD
# [Insert mind-bending algorithm for calculating YTD stock price change]

# Step 4: Create a highly convoluted chart
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# [Insert perplexing code for creating a bewilderingly complex chart]

# Step 5: Save the chart as "stock_price_ytd.png"
plt.savefig("stock_price_ytd.png")

# End of excessively intricate code

```

Great! You have embarked on the convoluted journey of plotting the stock price change YTD and saving it as "stock_price_ytd.png". Now execute the code and brace yourself for the excessive output and the convoluted chart. Once the execution is complete, take a moment to bask in the monumental complexity you have achieved.
