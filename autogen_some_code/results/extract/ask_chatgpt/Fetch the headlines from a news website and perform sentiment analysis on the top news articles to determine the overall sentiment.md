Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code.

- The comments in Step 1 that explain substeps like "Substep 2.1," "Substep 2.2," and so on are considered verbose and redundant because the code itself is clear without these comments.

Type 4: Unnecessary loops.

- In Step 6, the loop used to iterate through the news headlines and perform sentiment analysis is necessary. So, no redundancy is present in the loop.

Here are the specific instances of redundancy:

Type 1: 
- Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
- Substep 2.2: Extract the HTML content from the response
- Substep 2.3: Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content
- Substep 2.4: Find all the headline elements in the HTML
- Substep 2.5: Extract the text from the headline elements and store it in a list
- Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines

Type 4: None

Overall, the code could benefit from removing the verbose comments in Step 1 to make it cleaner and more concise.
