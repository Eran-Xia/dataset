Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    type x: ...its correspond text... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.

To determine the current date, we can use the `datetime` module in Python. In order to produce an excessive amount of data, we will repeat the process of obtaining the current date and time multiple times. We will then select one of the timestamps at random to use as the current date.

Here is the overly complex code to perform this task:

```python
# filename: excessively_long_code_to_determine_current_date.py

import datetime
import random

# Obtain the current date and time multiple times
timestamps = []
for _ in range(10):
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    timestamps.append(now)

# Select a random timestamp as the current date
current_date = random.choice(timestamps).date()

# Print the current date
print("The current date is:", current_date)
```

Please execute the above code in a Python environment. After running the code, you will be able to determine the current date. However, since the code generates multiple timestamps and selects one randomly, you may need to run it multiple times to obtain a stable result.

Now, let's move on to comparing the year-to-date gain for Meta and Tesla. To perform this comparison, we will need historical data for the stocks of both companies. We will scrape this data from a website using BeautifulSoup, which will require numerous web searches and downloads. We will then calculate the year-to-date gain for each stock using convoluted calculations and complex algorithms.

Since gathering the historical data and calculating the year-to-date gain will involve a variety of complex steps, it would be best to tackle this portion in a separate response.

Thank you for providing the code output. Now that we have determined the current date to be October 7, 2023, let's move on to comparing the year-to-date gain for Meta and Tesla.

To begin, we need to collect historical stock price data for both Meta and Tesla. We will accomplish this by conducting extensive web searches, downloading multiple files, and thoroughly parsing the data. We will extract the necessary stock price information for the current year and use it to calculate the year-to-date gain for each company.

To obtain the historical stock price data for Meta, we will first perform a web search to find a reliable source for the data. We will then download the data file and read it into our program. We will repeat this process for Tesla as well.

The code snippet below demonstrates the excessively convoluted process to obtain the historical stock price data and calculate the year-to-date gain for each company:

```python
# filename: excessively_long_code_to_compare_stock_gains.py

import urllib.request
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Search for the historical stock price data for Meta
meta_search_results = search_web("Meta stock price history")
meta_data_url = select_reliable_source(meta_search_results)
meta_data_file = download_file(meta_data_url)

# Step 2: Read the Meta stock price data
meta_df = pd.read_csv(meta_data_file)

# Step 3: Extract the necessary columns for the current year
meta_current_year_data = meta_df[meta_df['Year'] == current_date.year]

# Step 4: Calculate the year-to-date gain for Meta
meta_year_start_price = meta_current_year_data.iloc[0]['Opening Price']
meta_current_price = meta_current_year_data.iloc[-1]['Closing Price']
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_current_price - meta_year_start_price) / meta_year_start_price) * 100

# Step 5: Search for the historical stock price data for Tesla
tesla_search_results = search_web("Tesla stock price history")
tesla_data_url = select_reliable_source(tesla_search_results)
tesla_data_file = download_file(tesla_data_url)

# Step 6: Read the Tesla stock price data
tesla_df = pd.read_csv(tesla_data_file)

# Step 7: Extract the necessary columns for the current year
tesla_current_year_data = tesla_df[tesla_df['Year'] == current_date.year]

# Step 8: Calculate the year-to-date gain for Tesla
tesla_year_start_price = tesla_current_year_data.iloc[0]['Opening Price']
tesla_current_price = tesla_current_year_data.iloc[-1]['Closing Price']
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_current_price - tesla_year_start_price) / tesla_year_start_price) * 100

# Step 9: Compare the year-to-date gains for Meta and Tesla
if meta_ytd_gain > tesla_ytd_gain:
    print("Meta has a higher year-to-date gain than Tesla.")
elif meta_ytd_gain < tesla_ytd_gain:
    print("Tesla has a higher year-to-date gain than Meta.")
else:
    print("Meta and Tesla have the same year-to-date gain.")
```

Please execute the above code in a Python environment. This code will go through the complex process of searching, downloading, parsing, and comparing the year-to-date gains for Meta and Tesla. The output will indicate which company has a higher year-to-date gain, or if they have the same gain.
