To create a word cloud of the most common keywords in the headlines, we will follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the headlines from a source (e.g., a file or a web page).
2. Preprocess the headlines by removing any unnecessary characters or words.
3. Count the frequency of each word in the headlines.
4. Generate a word cloud based on the word frequencies.
5. Save the word cloud as an image file (e.g., word_cloud.png).

Let's begin!

First, we need to retrieve the headlines. Please provide the source of the headlines (e.g., a file path or a URL).
