CASE 1: Solving the Problem with Python Code Directly

To find the numbers "a" for which the graph of y = x^2 + a intersects with the graph of y = ax, we can solve the equation x^2 + a = ax.

To begin, we'll import the required packages, sympy for symbolic computation, and Interval from sympy.intervals for interval notation:

```python
# filename: find_intersecting_numbers.py

import sympy as sp
from sympy.intervals import Interval
```

Next, let's define the variables and equations. We'll use the symbols() function from sympy to create the variables "a" and "x". We'll also define the equations based on the given problem statement:

```python
a, x = sp.symbols("a x")
equation1 = x ** 2 + a
equation2 = a * x
```

Now, we can solve the equation x^2 + a = ax to find the intersection points:

```python
solutions = sp.solve(sp.Eq(equation1, equation2), x)
```

To find the corresponding values of "a" for each intersection point, we'll substitute the solutions back into equation2 and solve for "a":

```python
intersections = []
for solution in solutions:
    a_values = sp.solve(sp.Eq(equation2.subs(x, solution), a), a)
    intersections.extend(a_values)
```

Finally, we'll convert the values of "a" to interval notation using the Interval class from sympy.intervals:

```python
interval_notation = [Interval(left, right) for left, right in sp.seq.sparse_contiguous_range(intersections)]
```

To display the answer, we'll use the print() function, following the required format:

```python
print(f"The numbers a for which the graphs intersect are {interval_notation}")
```

Let's go ahead and run the code to find the numbers "a".

```python
# your code
```

My apologies once again for the error. It seems that the `sympy.intervals` module is not available in the version of SymPy you have installed. 

Instead of using `sympy.intervals.Interval`, we can achieve the same result by manually constructing the interval notation. 

Let me provide you with an updated code snippet that utilizes this alternative method:

```python
# filename: find_intersecting_numbers.py

import sympy as sp

# Define the variables and equations
a, x = sp.symbols("a x")
equation1 = x ** 2 + a
equation2 = a * x

# Solve the equation x^2 + a = ax to find the intersection points
solutions = sp.solve(sp.Eq(equation1, equation2), x)

# Find the corresponding values of "a" for each intersection point
intersections = []
for solution in solutions:
    a_values = sp.solve(sp.Eq(equation2.subs(x, solution), a), a)
    intersections.extend(a_values)

# Construct the interval notation manually
interval_notation = []
for a_value in intersections:
    if isinstance(a_value, sp.Rational):  # Check if the value is a fraction
        interval_notation.append(f"[{float(a_value)}]")
    else:
        interval_notation.append(f"[{float(a_value)}, {float(a_value)}]")

# Display the answer
print(f"The numbers a for which the graphs intersect are {interval_notation}")
