To solve this problem, we can use the method of elimination. This involves eliminating one variable by subtracting the equations from each other. In this case, we'll eliminate the variable 'y'. 

Here's the plan:
1. Solve the system of equations using the method of elimination to find the values of 'x' and 'y'.
2. Calculate the value of 'x - y' using the obtained values of 'x' and 'y'.
3. Print the value of 'x - y' in fraction form.

To solve the system of equations using the method of elimination, we'll subtract one equation from the other to eliminate the variable 'y'. Let's begin by writing the equations:

Equation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500
Equation 2: 729x + 731y = 1508

Now, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(729x + 731y) - (725x + 727y) = 1508 - 1500

Rewriting the equation with the terms in the same order:

4x + 4y = 8

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get:

x + y = 2

Now, we have a new equation: x + y = 2.

To solve for 'x' and 'y' from this equation, we can set one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for 'y' in terms of 'x':

y = 2 - x

We now have the values of 'x' and 'y'. Let's calculate 'x - y' using the obtained values.

x - y = x - (2 - x) = x - 2 + x = 2x - 2

So, the value of 'x - y' is 2x - 2.

Now, let's write the Python code to solve this problem step-by-step and print the value of 'x - y' in fraction form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the system of equations
# Equation 1: 725x + 727y = 1500
# Equation 2: 729x + 731y = 1508

# Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2
equation_diff = (729 - 725) * x + (731 - 727) * y - (1508 - 1500)

# Simplify the equation
equation_simplified = equation_diff / 4

# Solve for 'x'
x = Symbol('x')
y = 2 - x

# Calculate 'x - y'
x_minus_y = 2*x - 2

# Print the value of 'x - y' in fraction form
print("The value of x - y is:", Fraction(x_minus_y))
```

Note: Since the value of 'x - y' is not provided in a specific form, we have represented it as 2x - 2 for clarity.

Now, go ahead and run the code.

Apologies for the mistakes in my previous responses. Let's revisit the problem statement and solve it step by step.

Given equations:
725x + 727y = 1500   ...(1)
729x + 731y = 1508   ...(2)

To find the value of x - y, we can use the method of elimination.

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 729 and equation (2) by 725 to eliminate the coefficients of x.

Resulting equations:
529525x + 529512y = 1093500   ...(3)
529525x + 529525y = 1097900   ...(4)

Step 2: Subtract equation (3) from equation (4) to eliminate the x term.

Resulting equation:
529525y - 529512y = 1097900 - 1093500

Simplifying the equation:
13y = 4400

Step 3: Solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 13.

Result:
y = 4400 / 13

Now, let's calculate the value of y and continue to the next step.

```python
# Calculation to find the value of y
y = 4400 / 13

# Print the value of y
print("The value of y is:", y)

Thank you for providing the value of y. Let's continue to the next step.

Step 4: Substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use equation (1).

725x + 727y = 1500

Substituting the value of y:

725x + 727 * 338.46153846153845 = 1500

Now, we can solve this equation for x.

```python
# Calculation to find the value of x
x = (1500 - 727 * y) / 725

# Print the value of x
print("The value of x is:", x)
```

Please run the code to calculate the value of x.

Code redundancy includes the following types followed by some detailed examples:
    Type 1: Verbose comments for Non-essential code. 
    Example 1:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 1, the comment on importing python libraries is rebundant as importing libraries is common in the python code.
    Example 2:
    '''
    # Step 1: Define a list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    '''
    In example 2, the comment is rebundant as the code for defining the list is not crucial.
    Example 3:
    '''
    # Substep 2.6: Return the list of news headlines
        return headlines_text
    '''
    In example 3, the comment is rebundant as the return statement in the code is very straightforward.
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Substep 2.1: Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    '''
    In example 4, the comment is rebundant as the code statement is very straightforward.
    Type 2: Superfluous names of variables in the solution.
    Example 5:
    '''
        first_number = 10
        second_number = 5
    ''' 
    In example 5, the variable names are rebundant as "first_number" and "second_number" can be shorten to shorter names.
    Type 3: Redundant and nonsensical statements.
    Example 6:
    '''
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x == 5:
        y = y * 2
    else:
        y = y * 2
    ''' 
    In example 6, the if statement is rebundant as both branches have the same effect.
    Type 4: Unnecessary loops.
    Example 7:
    '''
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        number = numbers[i]
        print("The number is:", number)
    ''' 
    In example 7,the loop statement is rebundant as there is no need  to conduct an unnecessarily complicated way to iterate through a list in Python.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:

Thank you for providing the value of x. Now, let's continue to calculate the value of x - y.

Step 5: Calculate the value of x - y using the obtained values of x and y.

x - y = -337.3262599469496 - 338.46153846153845

```python
# Calculation to find the value of x - y
x_minus_y = x - y

# Print the value of x - y
print("The value of x - y is:", x_minus_y)
