Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_normal_assistant1 (to normal_user_proxy1):

To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we can follow these steps:

1. Expand both sides of the inequality:
   $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$
   $2x^2+16x+30<3x^2+39x+72$

2. Simplify the inequality by subtracting $(2x^2+16x+30)$ from both sides:
   $3x^2+39x+72-(2x^2+16x+30)>0$
   $x^2+23x+42>0$

3. Factorize the quadratic expression $x^2+23x+42$:
   $(x+6)(x+7)>0$

4. Determine the sign of the expression $(x+6)(x+7)$. To do this, we need to consider the sign of each factor.

   a. If $x+6>0$ and $x+7>0$, then the expression is positive. This is true for $x>-6$ and $x>-7$.

   b. If $x+6<0$ and $x+7<0$, then the expression is positive. This is true for $x<-6$ and $x<-7$.

   c. If $x+6<0$ and $x+7>0$, then the expression is negative. This is true for $-7<x<-6$.

   d. If $x+6>0$ and $x+7<0$, then the expression is negative. This is true for $x<-7$ and $x>-6$.

5. Based on the above analysis, the expression $(x+6)(x+7)$ is positive for $x>-6$ and $x>-7$, and negative for $-7<x<-6$. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $x<-7$ or $x>-6$.

To express the solution in interval notation, we can write the solution as $(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)$.

_normal_assistant1 (to normal_user_proxy1):

To solve the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we have already determined that the solution is $x<-7$ or $x>-6$.

Now let's express the solution in interval notation:

The solution can be written as $(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)$.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)}

Problem:
Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebundant_assistant1 (to rebundant_user_proxy1):

To solve the given inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$, we will follow the third case mentioned in the requirements. We will solve the problem step by step and ask queries whenever necessary.

Step 1: Expand the expressions on both sides of the inequality:
$(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 < 3x^2 + 27x + 72$

Step 2: Simplify the inequality by subtracting the common terms from both sides:
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 - (3x^2 + 27x + 72) < 0$
$2x^2 + 16x + 30 - 3x^2 - 27x - 72 < 0$
$-x^2 - 11x - 42 < 0$

Step 3: Ask Python to solve the quadratic equation $-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$ and find the solutions for x.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebundant_assistant1 (to rebundant_user_proxy1):

As per your request, I will continue to solve the problem until I need to query. Let's proceed with the solution.

Step 4: Factorize the quadratic equation $-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$ to find the solutions for x. To factorize the quadratic equation, we can write it in the form $(x - a)(x - b) = 0$, where a and b are the solutions.

$-x^2 - 11x - 42 = 0$
$-(x^2 + 11x + 42) = 0$
$(x + 6)(x + 7) = 0$

Step 5: Set each factor to zero to find the values of x that satisfy the equation:

$x + 6 = 0$
$x = -6$

$x + 7 = 0$
$x = -7$

Step 6: We have obtained the solutions $x = -6$ and $x = -7$. Now we need to find the intervals where the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$ holds true.

Step 7: Check the sign of the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for values of x in different intervals to determine when the inequality is satisfied.

To do this, we will create a number line and test the expression for three different intervals: 

Interval 1: $(-\infty, -7)$
Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$
Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$

Step 8: Test the expression for each interval:

For Interval 1: $(-\infty, -7)$
Choose a value x that is less than -7, for example, -10:
$-(-10)^2 - 11(-10) - 42 < 0$
$-100 + 110 - 42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$math_question_list-100 + 110 - 42 = -32 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 1.

Step 9: Ask Python to calculate the expression for Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebundant_assistant1 (to rebundant_user_proxy1):

Apologies for the delay. As per your request, let's continue solving the problem until we need to query. 

Step 9: As mentioned earlier, we will now calculate the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for the interval $(-7, -6)$ to determine if the inequality holds true.

For Interval 2: $(-7, -6)$
Choose a value x between -7 and -6, for example, -6.5:
$-(-6.5)^2 - 11(-6.5) - 42 < 0$
$-42.25 + 71.5 - 42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$-42.25 + 71.5 - 42 = -12.75 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 2 as well.

Step 10: Ask Python to calculate the expression for Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$.

rebundant_assistant1 (to rebundant_user_proxy1):

Apologies for the delay. As per your request, let's continue solving the problem until we need to query.

Step 10: Let's calculate the expression $-x^2 - 11x - 42$ for the interval $(-6, \infty)$ to check if the inequality holds true.

For Interval 3: $(-6, \infty)$
Choose a value x greater than -6, for example, 0:
$-(0)^2 - 11(0) - 42 < 0$
$-42 < 0$

Calculating further:
$-42 < 0$

So, the inequality holds true for Interval 3 as well.

Step 11: Now that we have determined that the inequality holds true for all three intervals, we can write the solution in interval notation.

The solution to the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$ is $x \in \boxed{(-\infty, -7) \cup (-6, \infty)}$.
